# Skills

- skill: Organizational leadership
  description: Experience as a field organizer and an administrator I have acquired the skills to lead a group of people.  As a field organizer I found ways to utilize people to make an operation like Get Out The Vote to run effectively and efficiently.

- skill: IT infrastructure design
  description: Administration teaches one to be crafty&#47;creative in how they design their infrastructure to support users.  As a linux administrator I learned how to cater to those needs of the users and how to say no, although that was rare.  I also learned how important new technologies, like virtualization, can be in building or maintaining an IT infrastructure.

- skill: Diagnostics
  description: Troubleshooting an issue takes experience and patience.  My experience has been built over the years with a patience to look over the logs, analyze rogue processes, practice trial and error, or gain a greater in-depth knowledge of the software I am diagnosing.

- skill: Virtualization
  description: VMware, KVM, and Xen are the virtualization projects I am most familiar. Efficiency, resiliency, and portability were a few reasons I preferred to use this technology.  A scenario I was faced with was having different services running on different virtual machines to ease in the updates&#47;backups performed weekly, monthly, or yearly.

- skill: Linux&#47;OS X
  description: I have experience with Linux&#47;OS X in a server environment.  The infrastructure I administered handled email&#47;backups&#47;roaming profiles&#47;file sharing&#47;virtualization.

- skill: Networking
  description: Having an understanding of LAN&#47;WAN technologies is crucial for any IT specialist wanting to excel in this field.  Software developers are interacting in the cloud more everyday.  My skills gained through CCNA&#47;CCNP courses can help while operating in the domain of software development.

- skill: Scripting
  description: The ability to automate your services can mean getting a good night sleep.  As a linux administrator I familiarized myself with bash and python automate critical services.  When cleaning&#47;filtering&#47;presenting data from logs I find these two scripting languages to be most helpful.
