#  summary: I was in charge of about 20-30 users, all of whom used either linux or Mac OS X. Users would always be requesting my assistance in installing, updating, or debugging software. In this Red Hat linux enivornment, I would have to maintain or debug services, which were crucial to the operation of the clients; some of these services include: LDAP, NFS, Email, SVN, Web servers, RAID, DNS, and Print servers. This job required me to sometimes come up with creative solutions for which there was not a general solution; an example of this was when I was given the task to convert all of physical servers to virtual servers.
